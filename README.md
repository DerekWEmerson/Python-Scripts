# Python Scripts

A collection of small Python scripts I created while learning and practicing different concepts. These are by no means all complete or perfect but are still important to my learning journey. Scripts range from basic input handling and game logic to string manipulation and file analysis.

## What's Included
- `numsort.py`: A number sorting tool with user input, validation, and optional sorting order
- `calendar_calculator.py`: Calculates and formats dates, converting them into day/month/year formats with weekday names
- `rock-paper-scissors.py`: A simple interactive version of Rock, Paper, Scissors
- `madlib.py`: A Mad Libs game where the user creates their own silly story
- `bookbot.py`: A basic text analyzer that counts words and letters from a text file (e.g. Frankenstein)

## Tools Used
- Python (basic syntax, conditionals, loops, functions, file I/O)

## Notes
- These scripts were made for learning, not production, but show a range of skills and ideas
- Some scripts (like `calendar_calculator.py`) were left unfinished or partially open-ended for future improvements
